# libhadoopgis
*libhadoopgis* is library version of [HadoopGIS](https://github.com/Hadoop-GIS/Hadoop-GIS) - a 
scalable and high performance spatial data warehousing system for running spatial queries on 
Hadoop. *libhadoopgis* comes with a set of easy to use scripts which enables you to run 
hadoopgis queries on Amazon EMR.

## Library Dependecies:
*libhadoopgis * relies on two libraries for performaing spatial data processing. An [EMR bootstrap action] (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticMapReduce/latest/DeveloperGuide/emr-plan-bootstrap.html) script is provided in the libhadopgis repository.

- GEOS 3.x (x >= 3)

- libspatialindex 1.8.x (x >= 0)

## AWS Dependecy (for CLI):
Amazon Elastic MapReduce Command Line Interface: [Amazon EMR CLI] (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticMapReduce/latest/DeveloperGuide/emr-
cli-install.html)

## Steps to Run on AWS EMR:

### Source code compilation and configuration:

1. Cluster Creation with Amazon EMR CLI:
  * Create a cluster instance of EMR (EC2) and login into it using ssh via the AWS EMR CLI interface. This can be done in shell via:

```bash 
./elastic-mapreduce --create --alive --name "compilerandtest" --num-instances=1 --master-instance-type=m1.medium
```


  * ssh to the cluster with jobflow ID created with the step above:

```bash
   ./elastic-mapreduce --ssh â€“jobflow jobflow_id
```

2. Dowload and compile *libhadoopgis* on the cluster:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ablimit/libhadoopgis
cd tiler
make

cd joiner
make
```

3. Upload the libhadopgis folder to Amazon S3.

### Running *libhadoopgis* from AWS web interface
1. Login to the AWS Management Console and select Elastic MapReduce.
